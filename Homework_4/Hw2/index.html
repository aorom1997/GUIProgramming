    Hello, I am Anthony Rom!
  </h1>
    <p>
	I am a senior at UMass Lowell. I major in Computer Science where I aim to focus on robotics. 
	<br> I am also enrolled in the UTeach minor which focuses on teaching students to become STEM teachers in a school setting. 
	<br> More info about UTeach can be found  <a href="https://www.uml.edu/education/become-teacher/undergraduate/stem-minor.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.
	<br> <br>
	To showcase my progress in learning HTML, I have included a <a href ="http://cs.uml.edu/~arom/Hw2/ChocoCake.html" target="_blank"> Chocolate Cake Recipe</a>. In this website, I include <br>
        an unordered, ordered list, and an image.

    Hobbies
  </h2>
    <p>
        During my free time I enjoy relaxing and listening to soothing music. For example, LoFi or Chillhop, which usually includes 
        <br> a few or no vocals. When I am feeling active I like to skate and ride my bike around the neighboorhood.
